Data Set Definition 

## ðŸ“Š Dataset Field Descriptions

| Field Name                        | Description |
|----------------------------------|-------------|
| `sim_swap_time_gap_minutes`      | The time difference in minutes between the last SIM change and the current OTP request.<br>ðŸ’¡ A **low value** (e.g., 1â€“2 mins) may indicate a fraud attempt, as fraudsters typically request OTPs shortly after swapping the SIM. |
| `sim_swap_flag`                  | A boolean label indicating whether the last network record is a **confirmed SIM swap**. Used as the ground truth for training/evaluation. |
| `device_change_flag`             | Indicates whether the **device (e.g., IMEI)** has changed compared to historical records.<br>ðŸ’¡ `true` = suspicious if changed along with SIM. |
| `sim_type_change_flag`           | Indicates whether the **type of SIM** (e.g., physical to eSIM) changed.<br>ðŸ’¡ May signal fraud or just a legitimate upgrade â€” needs correlation. |
| `imsi_change_flag`               | IMSI = International Mobile Subscriber Identity. A change indicates the user **swapped SIMs**. |
| `iccid_change_flag`              | ICCID = SIM card identifier. A change means the **SIM card was physically replaced**. |
| `otp_and_sim_change_geo_hash_length` | The **geohash prefix length** shared between the location of the SIM change and the OTP request.<br>ðŸ’¡ A **shorter shared prefix** (e.g., 2â€“4) means the locations are far apart â†’ suspicious.<br>ðŸ’¡ A **longer match** (e.g., 9â€“10) means OTP was requested from the same/nearby location â†’ normal. |

## ðŸ“Œ Quick Interpretations

| Sample Row                                     | What's Going On |
|------------------------------------------------|-----------------|
| `2,true,true,true,false,true,3`               | SIM swap happened just 2 mins before OTP. New device and SIM type + changed ICCID. But IMSI same. Locations far apart (**geohash length 3**). âž¤ **Very suspicious**. |
| `1440,false,false,false,false,false,9`        | 1 day since SIM change, no other changes. Locations match well. âž¤ **Normal behavior**. |
| `1,true,true,true,true,true,2`                | **Extreme case**: 1-minute gap, all identity-related fields changed, and locations very far apart. âž¤ **High fraud risk**. |
| `10080,false,false,false,false,false,10`      | SIM change occurred 1 week ago, no other changes, OTP came from same location. âž¤ **Very safe behavior**. |
